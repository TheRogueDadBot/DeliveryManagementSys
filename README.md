    <h1>Delivery Management System (DMS)</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Delivery Management System (DMS) is a sophisticated routing and package management application designed for the Western Governors University Parcel Service (WGUPS). This project showcases a practical application of algorithms and data structures to address real-world problems in package delivery logistics. The DMS optimizes delivery routes and ensures timely distribution of packages, addressing the challenge of maintaining efficiency in daily local deliveries (DLD).</p>

  <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul class="section">
        <li>Efficient Routing Algorithm: Implements the Nearest Neighbor algorithm for optimal route planning under specific operational constraints.</li>
        <li>Hash Table Implementation: Custom-built hash table for fast access and management of package data.</li>
        <li>Scalable Solution: Designed to be adaptable for various cities, catering to a broad operational scope.</li>
        <li>User Interface: Provides an intuitive interface for monitoring package delivery statuses and total mileage.</li>
        <li>Real-Time Adjustments: Capable of handling dynamic changes in package information and routing.</li>
    </ul>
