# Delivery Management System (DMS)

## Introduction

The Delivery Management System (DMS) is a sophisticated routing and package management application designed for the Western Governors University Parcel Service (WGUPS). This project showcases a practical application of algorithms and data structures to address real-world problems in package delivery logistics. The DMS optimizes delivery routes and ensures timely distribution of packages, addressing the challenge of maintaining efficiency in daily local deliveries (DLD).

## Key Features

- Efficient Routing Algorithm: Implements the Nearest Neighbor algorithm for optimal route planning under specific operational constraints.
- Hash Table Implementation: Custom-built hash table for fast access and management of package data.
- Scalable Solution: Designed to be adaptable for various cities, catering to a broad operational scope.
- User Interface: Provides an intuitive interface for monitoring package delivery statuses and total mileage.
- Real-Time Adjustments: Capable of handling dynamic changes in package information and routing.

## Technical Overview

- Language & Libraries: Developed in Python, leveraging its standard libraries for handling data operations.
- Data Structures: Utilizes hash tables, custom classes, and lists to manage and process delivery data efficiently.
- Algorithms: Employs the Nearest Neighbor algorithm for routing, tailored for real-time decision-making and local optimization.
- Simulation Capabilities: Simulates the delivery process, providing insights into the operational aspects of package delivery.
